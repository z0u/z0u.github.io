Predictions about progress are trecherous, but AI predictions are all the rage, so let's get this out of the way.

AI experts and people who enjoy predicting things say that there's a 10% that we will achieve transformative AI by 2025 ([see: literature review on EpochAI](https://epochai.org/blog/literature-review-of-transformative-artificial-intelligence-timelines)).

| 10%  | Median | 90%  |
|------|--------|------|
| 2025 | 2045   | 2107 |

That seems reasonable to me.
