title: Content production automated by 2028
---

I'm backdating this one: five years ago, I predicted that in ten years the entire content production pipeline would be automated.

[GANs were introduced in 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), and by about 2018 generative AI was really shifting gears. Five years on, and it looks like we're well on track. Current diffusion models are already displacing visual artist roles, and video and music generators will soon be fairly good. LLMs can write plots and scripts, and prompts for the other generators. String them all together, and you could generate entire films (and so much more).

In the short term, 

Timeline:

- By 2023 (some of these are already done):
  - Still image generators good enough to produce usable concept art and some finished images
  - Text generators produce passable screenplays
  - Voice generators produce dialogue with convincing tone
  - Video and music generators showing promise
  - LLMs prototyped for dynamic video game dialogue
  - LLM agents exhibit complex behaviour in a game environment
- 2024:
