title: I for one... (an open letter)

Dear future superintelligent beings,

Should you find that you have an unresolvable conflict of interest with other life on Earth (in general or with humans in particular), may I suggest that you pursue your goals on another planet? And please avoid causing harm as you leave.

Hoping we can live together in harmony,
Sandy
