My YConf 2022 talk with Micah Sargisson.

> Customers today expect simple and seamless experiences. How do you create a digital tool that manages the complexities of designing a 3D space, that provides not only utility in planning and design, but inspiration, enabling users to explore their ideas and boost their confidence in what they're designing? In this talk, we present some considerations and challenges when designing 3D experiences, and how to approach product development and structure teams to solve difficult challenges.
